# Experiments in Computery Stuff

Hypothesis: 99.9% of everything in this repository won't amount to anything.

## Guidelines

1. Every experiment should be self-contained in its own folder. Even when code reusability seems like a good idea, 
reproducibility is a much more important objective.
2. When an experiment gets too large, it deserves its own repository.
3. When an experiment becomes substantially successful, it deserves its own repository and paper submission.
4. When an experiment fails, it stays in this repository.
